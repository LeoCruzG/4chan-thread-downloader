This are some scripts used to download threads form an specific board along with some json files used as an example. It was used for data analysis and prepares a file to clean on openrefine or somewhere else. This was used to analyze the trends of the politically incorrect (pol) board during the time of US elections where Biden and Trump were competing. It uses the 4chan API. Also it's heavily commented in spanish, reach out if you want me to translate it to english.
